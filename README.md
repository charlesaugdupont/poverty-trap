# A Multi-Scalar Agent-Based Model of Poverty Trap Formation

## Summary

This repository accompanies the paper entitled **"A Multi-Scalar Agent-Based Model of Poverty Trap Formation"**, submitted as part of a Master's Thesis project at the University of Amsterdam.

## Development

This repository is under active development with the goal of providing re-usable code for researchers to replicate results or apply our framework to other data.

## Guide
Below is a description of the various directories in the repository and what they contain.

- `data_processing_scripts` : Python scripts to concatenate and combine the results of simulations for different parameter combinations and repetitions
- `jobs` : Bash scripts for job submission to Snellius
- `models` : Python files containing models for different experimental setups (network topologies, portfolio optimisation methods ...)
- `notebooks` : Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis, plotting of figures, testing of various model components
- `simulation_scripts` : Python scripts to run the various experimental setups for different parameter combinations and multiple repetitions
